   In human anatomy, the muscles of the hip joint are those muscles that
   cause movement in the hip. Most modern anatomists define 17 of these
   muscles, although some additional muscles may sometimes be considered.
   These are often divided into four groups according to their orientation
   around the hip joint: the gluteal group; the lateral rotator group; the
   adductor group; and the iliopsoas group.

Structure

   The muscles of the hip consist of four main groups

Gluteal group

   Main article: Gluteal muscles

   The gluteal muscles include the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius,
   gluteus minimus, and tensor fasciae latae. They cover the lateral
   surface of the ilium. The gluteus maximus, which forms most of the
   muscle of the buttocks, originates primarily on the ilium and sacrum
   and inserts on the gluteal tuberosity of the femur as well as the
   iliotibial tract, a tract of strong fibrous tissue that runs along the
   lateral thigh to the tibia and fibula. The gluteus medius and gluteus
   minimus originate anterior to the gluteus maximus on the ilium and both
   insert on the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae
   shares its origin with the gluteus maximus at the ilium and also shares
   the insertion at the iliotibial tract.

Adductor group

   Main article: Adductor muscles of the hip

   The adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus, pectineus, and
   gracilis make up the adductor group. The adductors all originate on the
   pubis and insert on the medial, posterior surface of the femur, with
   the exception of the gracilis which inserts just below the medial
   condyle of the tibia.

Iliopsoas group

   Main article: Iliopsoas

   The iliacus and psoas major comprise the iliopsoas group. The psoas
   major is a large muscle that runs from the bodies and disc of the L1 to
   L5 vertebrae, joins with the iliacus via its tendon, and connects to
   the lesser trochanter of the femur. The iliacus originates on the iliac
   fossa of the ilium. Together these muscles are commonly referred to as
   the "iliopsoas".

Lateral rotator group

   Main article: Lateral rotator group

   This group consists of the externus and internus obturators, the
   piriformis, the superior and inferior gemelli, and the quadratus
   femoris. These six originate at or below the acetabulum of the ilium
   and insert on or near the greater trochanter of the femur.

Other hip muscles

   Additional muscles, such as the rectus femoris and the sartorius, can
   cause some movement in the hip joint. However these muscles primarily
   move the knee, and not generally classified as muscles of the hip.

   The hamstring muscles, which originate mostly from the ischial
   tuberosity inserting on the tibia/fibula, have a large moment assisting
   with hip extension.

Function

   Movements of the hip occur because multiple muscles activate at once.
   Most muscles are also responsible for more than one type of movement.

   Movements of the hip are described in anatomical terminology using
   anatomical terms of motion. The movement that brings the thighs close
   to the abdomen is called "flexion". When the legs open, such as in the
   lotus posture of yoga, this is called "lateral rotation", with the
   opposite movement called "medial rotation". Hip abduction occurs when
   the femur moves outward to the side, as in taking the thighs apart. Hip
   adduction occurs when the femur moves back to the midline. Many muscles
   contribute to these movements:
     * The psoas is the primary hip flexor, assisted by the iliacus. The
       pectineus, the adductors longus, brevis, and magnus, as well as the
       tensor fasciae latae are also involved in flexion.
     * The gluteus maximus is the main hip extensor, but the inferior
       portion of the adductor magnus also plays a role.
     * The adductor group is responsible for hip adduction.
     * Medial rotation is performed by the gluteus medius and gluteus
       minimus, as well as the tensor fasciae latae and assisted by the
       adductors brevis and longus and the superior portion of the
       adductor magnus.
     * Each muscle of the lateral rotator group causes lateral rotation of
       the thigh. These muscles are aided by the gluteus maximus and the
       inferior portion of the adductor magnus.

   Hips muscles also play a role in maintaining the standing posture.
   These muscles work in an integrated system with muscles of the
   shoulder, neck, core, lower leg, and supporting muscles of the spine,
   to provide the ability to stand with good posture. These muscles
   include the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus which abduct the thigh,
   prevent swaying of hips, stabilize pelvic region while keeping hips
   level, and shift an individualâ€™s weight in order to adjust body
   placement to increase one's overall body stability.
